SGF4J GUI
=========

GUI for Go game. It is still work in progress as I continue to hack away on this. I'm playing around with JavaFX for this project. Once this is more useful I'll write up the doc.

Running It
==========

I haven't packaged the program into a executable. If you want to take it for a spin then clone the repository, issue a `mvn install` and run the JAR file `java -jar sgf4j-gui.jar`
